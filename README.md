# Continuum

**A knowledge graph for capturing engineering decisions from human-AI coding sessions**

> 🔬 Research project in development

## Overview

Continuum automatically extracts decision traces from AI-assisted coding conversations and visualizes them as an interactive knowledge graph. It transforms ephemeral human-AI collaboration into structured, searchable knowledge.

### Research Context

This project explores human-AI collaboration patterns in software engineering—specifically how decisions are made, communicated, and can be preserved during AI-assisted development.

**Project Lead**: Ali Shehral (shehral.m@northeastern.edu)

**Affiliation**: HCAI Lab, Northeastern University

**Status**: Active Development

## Features

- **Passive Knowledge Capture**: Automatically extract decisions from Claude Code conversation logs
- **AI-Guided Interviews**: NVIDIA Llama-powered interview agent guides knowledge capture
- **Knowledge Graph**: Interactive visualization of decisions and their relationships
- **Decision Traces**: Structured capture of trigger, context, options, decision, and rationale
- **Entity Resolution**: 7-stage deduplication pipeline with configurable similarity thresholds
- **Hybrid Search**: Combined lexical and semantic search with score fusion
- **Graph Validation**: Detect circular dependencies, orphans, duplicates, and relationship issues
